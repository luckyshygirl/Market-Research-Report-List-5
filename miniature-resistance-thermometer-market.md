<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Miniature Resistance Thermometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire Configuration</li><li>Three-wire Configuration</li><li>Four-wire Configuration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Miniature resistance thermometers are commonly available in three types of configurations: two-wire, three-wire, and four-wire. The two-wire configuration is the simplest and most cost-effective option, but it is prone to inaccuracies due to lead wire resistance. The three-wire configuration helps in compensating for lead wire resistance, resulting in more accurate temperature measurements. The four-wire configuration provides the highest level of accuracy by completely eliminating lead wire resistance effects, making it ideal for precision temperature sensing applications.</p></p>
