<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete 3D Printer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gantry Systems</li><li>Robotic Arm Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete 3D printers are typically categorized into two main types based on their structure and movement capabilities: Gantry Systems and Robotic Arm Systems. Gantry Systems are stationary printers with a gantry structure that moves the printhead along the X and Y axes, while the build platform moves along the Z axis. On the other hand, Robotic Arm Systems utilize robotic arms to move the printhead in multiple directions, offering more flexibility and intricate design capabilities. Each system has its own advantages and is suitable for different applications in the construction industry.</p></p>
