<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gray Hydrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Gas Reforming</li><li>Coal Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gray hydrogen can be produced using natural gas reforming or coal processing methods. In the natural gas reforming market, methane is combined with steam at high temperatures to produce hydrogen, releasing carbon dioxide as a byproduct. In the coal processing market, coal is gasified to produce hydrogen, also releasing carbon dioxide. Both methods result in carbon emissions, hence the term "gray hydrogen." These markets cater to industries looking for low-cost hydrogen production, despite the environmental implications.</p></p>
