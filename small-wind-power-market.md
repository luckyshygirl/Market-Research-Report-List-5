<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Wind Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small wind power market consists of two main types of wind turbines: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs are the most common type and have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, capturing wind from one direction. VAWTs, on the other hand, have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, allowing them to capture wind from any direction. Each type has its own advantages and is suited for different applications based on factors like wind speed and space constraints.</p></p>
