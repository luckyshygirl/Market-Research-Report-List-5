<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Receivers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy</li><li>Synchronous Digital Hierarchy</li><li>Synchronous Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical receivers are classified into three main types based on their signal timing standards: Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), and Synchronous Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (SPDH). </p><p>PDH uses multiple transmission rates that are slightly different from each other, resulting in variable end-to-end delay. SDH, on the other hand, maintains a constant bit rate and fixed time slots for transmission. SPDH combines the features of both PDH and SDH, providing a flexible and efficient solution for network communication.</p></p>
