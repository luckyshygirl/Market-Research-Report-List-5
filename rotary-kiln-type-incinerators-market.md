<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Kiln Type Incinerators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Counter Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators</li><li>Co-Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary kiln type incinerators are used for waste disposal in various industries. There are two main types of rotary kiln incinerators - Counter Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators and Co-Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators. In Counter Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators, the waste and combustion gases move in opposite directions, allowing for efficient and thorough combustion. On the other hand, in Co-Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators, the waste and combustion gases move in the same direction, which can lead to lower efficiency but is suitable for certain types of waste streams.</p></p>
