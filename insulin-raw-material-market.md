<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Raw Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regular Human Insulin</li><li>Insulin Analogue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insulin Raw Material Market includes two main types: Regular Human Insulin and Insulin Analogue. Regular Human Insulin is derived from the pancreas of pigs or cows, and is chemically identical to the insulin produced by the human body. Insulin Analogue, on the other hand, is a synthetic form of insulin that has been modified to either mimic the body's natural insulin production more closely, or to have different rates of absorption and duration of action. Both types of insulin are essential for managing diabetes and regulating blood sugar levels.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Insulin Raw Material Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fast-acting</li><li>Intermediate-acting</li><li>Long-acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insulin Raw Material Market applications can be categorized into three types based on their duration of action: fast-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting. Fast-acting insulin is rapidly absorbed and starts working within minutes, typically used to control blood sugar levels after meals. Intermediate-acting insulin takes longer to start working and lasts for a few hours, providing a more sustained effect on blood sugar levels. Long-acting insulin releases slowly over an extended period, providing a basal level of insulin throughout the day.</p></p>
