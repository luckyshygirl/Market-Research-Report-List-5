<p><h1>Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) Market Provides Detailed Segmentation of this Market based on Type, Application, and Region and Forecast for the Period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) is a method of testing for fetal chromosomal abnormalities without the need for invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. It involves analyzing cell-free fetal DNA present in the maternal bloodstream to detect genetic conditions such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13.</p><p>The Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by factors such as increasing awareness about the benefits of NIPS, rising maternal age leading to a higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities, and advancements in technology leading to improved accuracy and reliability of NIPS tests.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the NIPS market is the introduction of expanded screening panels that can detect a wider range of genetic conditions. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards offering NIPS as a routine screening test for all pregnant women, regardless of age or risk factors. This is expected to further drive market growth as more healthcare providers adopt NIPS as a standard prenatal screening tool.</p></p>
