<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent Reuse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-site Solvent Recycling</li><li>Off-site Solvent Recycling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>On-site solvent recycling involves recycling solvents at the same location where they are used, typically within a facility or industrial setting. This method offers immediate reuse of solvents and reduced waste disposal costs. Off-site solvent recycling, on the other hand, involves sending solvents to a specialized recycling facility outside of the site. This method allows for more extensive processing and purification of solvents, resulting in higher quality recycled products. Both methods contribute to sustainability by reducing the amount of solvent waste generated.</p></p>
